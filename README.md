# wichtel

This is a really small java tool to *wichtel*. I don't know if it is only a german tradition but I could'nt find a good translation.

I was looking for a tool at GitHub before, found some Java projects, each of them too complicated and not very easy to use. That's why I have implemented my own version.

## What's wichtel?
You have *x* people and you want to give each of them exactly one counterpart that is your presentee.

## How does it work?
* Define the people: `participants.properties`
* Define the content of the mail: `mail.txt`
* Configure the credentials of your mail account: `credentials.properties`

Run the main program `Wichteln.java` and that's all.
